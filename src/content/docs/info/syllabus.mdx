This course is a first graduate course on compiler optimization
techniques that are commonly used at intermediate level and in the backend. The
following are the objectives of this course:

- In depth understanding of foundational concepts of optimizing compilers.
- Hands-on experience in building optimizations inside a real-world open
source compiler called LLVM.
- Understanding of current research results in one or more areas of optimizing compilers

We will achieve these goals by in-depth discussion of classical and modern compiler
analyses and optimizations. The course starts with a discussion of basic dataflow and
control flow analysis and building of necessary information at various levels of
intermediate forms through analysis. The techniques covered include first bit-vector
analysis followed by discussion of SSA form. Special analysis based on SSA form
(such as global value numbering) is discussed next. Finally, advanced dataflow
problems such as partial redundancy elimination (PRE) are discussed. We then shift
our attention to data dependence analysis used in modern high performance
compilers and its use in loop transformations for optimizing for memory hierarchy.
We will also talk about classical vectorization and SIMDization techniques relevant
to modern multi-cores. We will also discuss a bit of code generation optimizations
involving advanced register allocation, rematerialization, live range splitting,
coalescing and coloring. We will attempt to cover two important emerging areas
through papers in the second half of the course : (a) optimizing for embedded
processors, (b) compiler based techniques for multi-cores. A key part of the course
involves a large project (to be done in teams of 2 students) based on an open source
compiler (LLVM) to develop optimizations. After successfully completing this
course, it is expected that students will be ready to explore research literature on one
or more topics in compilers.
